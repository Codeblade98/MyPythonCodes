Hash function generates a pattern for an input

Even a small change in the string changes the Hash Pattern completely

But if we give the same input, we get the same output

The hash pattern generated is a key and the actual one is a value

So in reality we are running a key value pair 

Thus the hash pattern generated is mostly random
